            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I owe a duty to my Nation, and mu≈øt either endeavour to perform it, or be condemned of want of Religion and humanity. This hath obliged and emboldned me to tender this Mite as an oblation for the peace and welfare thereof to you the honourable Tru≈øtees of the Nation, by whom the people are in a longing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to be re≈øtored to their often promi≈øed and dearly purcha≈øed Rights and Liberties.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I have been too long a ≈øad Spectator of tho≈øe bloudy imbroylments, which have pierced through the Heart of this Nation, whereof I am a ≈øympathizing Member, and have ob≈øerved that the diver≈øity of opinions in point of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is that which hath been a principal motive to the mournful Tragedy, and ≈øtill renders the people un≈øatisfied and unreconciled. This cau≈øe being taken away, the effects may happily follow; and therefore I humbly crave
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:167917:3"/>
leave to pre≈øent the≈øe my ≈øolitary conceptions upon that ≈øubject.</p>
            <p>Not to trouble you over long with their vanity who are enemies to all Government, I ≈øhall only ≈øay, that albeit it be true, that during the ≈øhort time that Man continued in his innocency, there was none manife≈øtly appearing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe then there was no need of any, and none might have been had he continued ≈øtill in the ≈øame ≈øpotle≈ø≈øe condition: yet ≈øin being ≈øince crept into the whole mankinde by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> to que≈øtion now whether God doth tolerate and approve of Government, is to que≈øtion whether he hath left Man power to prevent tho≈øe infinites of inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which every day are multiplyed by the growth and over≈øpreading prevalency of ≈øin, and by con≈øequence to draw a ≈øu≈øpect upon the Creator, as if he were too unminde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the pre≈øervation of his own creatures.</p>
            <p>This being blown over, I ≈øhall now with your patience, endeavour to demon≈øtrate upon what right the Authority of your A≈ø≈øembly is founded, what power you have by virtue of that right, and how invalid their pretences are who ≈øtand in competition with that right. That ≈øo the lawfulne≈ø≈øe and fulne≈ø≈øe of your Authority being made clear, you may cheerfully proceed in the managing of that tru≈øt which the people of this Nation have repo≈øed in you, and they reduced to their wonted complyance with your Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> That which hath appeared your mo≈øt eminent oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent is Monarchy, which being by the Abetters truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, to be a ≈øole Government in one without Co-partners or limitation, is totally de≈øtructive to your Authority: Yet this form of Government (≈øay they) is of divine Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. But he that compares the definition with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that hath been every where publi≈øhed by tho≈øe of that opinion, wherein ≈øome of them contend, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of a Chri≈øtian Commonwealth ought to be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Regal, and partly Epi≈øcopal; other≈øome partly Regal and partly Presbyterian, and that both the one and the other (though in the hands of di≈øtinct and contemporary per≈øons) are of divine in≈øtitution, will hardly apprehend
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:167917:3"/>
any ≈øafety in adhering to a doctrine wherein he findes ≈øo much contradiction.</p>
            <p>Indeed in the judgement of any con≈øidering man the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine will ≈øeem extreamly impertinent, not only becau≈øe, if it ≈øhould be admitted that Monarchical Government is of divine Ordination, yet it will re≈øt di≈øputable who among≈øt infinite millions of men ought to be the only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch: But al≈øo becau≈øe according to their own definition and doctrine, he only can be ≈øaid to be a Monarch, who, as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had, hath from God the ≈øole dominion over the People of all Nations, and in the Bea≈øts of the field the like ≈øole propriety; and if it be true of that, or of the Monarchy of <hi>Augu≈øtus Coe≈øar,</hi> which comes neere≈øt to it, which they pretend of others, that they ought to de≈øcend he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditarily, either the late world knew no lawful Monarchs, if it did, it will be no le≈ø≈øe lawful to ≈øubdivide every of them into as many more as they contain families, then to divide tho≈øe Monarchies into ≈øo many as are now ≈øaid to be in Chri≈øtendome.</p>
            <p>This then may be concluded from their own premi≈øes, that it is as agreeable to the will of God to reduce Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical Government into Families, as to continue it in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths. And this ≈øeems to be the clear intendment of the in≈øtitution, a≈øwell by the example of the ≈øons of <hi>Noah,</hi> who without regard to the priority of bloud in the elder brother did each of them govern his own family Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally; as by that of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who having the advantage of extraordinary illumination, years and bloud, did not take cognizance in a ca≈øe of difference between his own and the ≈øervants of his Nephew <hi>Lot,</hi> but rather advi≈øed a ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to prevent the growing contention.</p>
            <p>There needs no more to prove, that every Ma≈øter of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily did or might originally govern his own dependents Monarchically and independently of any other humane authority: the di≈øpo≈øing therefore of the world into ≈øeveral Colonies or Commonwealths compo≈øed of divers families, cannot truly be taken to be the product of divine Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but of ≈øome political humane in≈øtitution, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever they may probably at the fir≈øt be quartered out by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:167917:4"/>
the violent deci≈øion of the ≈øword thir≈øty after rule and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; yet where God, who only may di≈øpen≈øe with his own laws, made it not lawful by ≈øome particular known Commi≈ø≈øion, could not be legally e≈øtabli≈øhed, but by the voluntary combination of agreeing families, over every of which the Superiour being by nature independent, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ≈øole juri≈ødiction within his own verge, who≈øoever did a≈ø≈øume a power in prejudice to that right did commit an act incon≈øi≈øtent with the end of a≈ø≈øociating, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regards the pre≈øervation of each incorporated Members propriety, and made him≈øelf guilty with <hi>Nimrod,</hi> of that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence which was never yet approved by Divinity.</p>
            <p>Be plea≈øed to take a ≈øcantling by a family, wherein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides only where nature ≈øeals the obligation, what allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is created is by con≈øent, as between Ma≈øters and ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Husbands and Wives, though that ≈øex be condemned to ≈øervitude by God him≈øelf, and you will ea≈øily admit that the Ma≈øters ≈øubjection is not lawfully acquirable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lower tearms: for it is too much below rea≈øon to think that the Superiour is naturally in a more ≈øervile condition then his ≈øubordinates; or allowing him the ≈øame freedom not to allow the ≈øame rule to hold in Commonwealths, which are but larger copies of that ≈ømaller Original. And therefore who≈øoever hath not a di≈øpo≈øition to contend (again≈øt all right) that the cu≈øtomary pretences and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of man have power to ≈øupercede everla≈øtingly a po≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law of God, will grant, that the Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Nation is of right really and independent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Fatherhood, not to be alienated but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> For the further manife≈øtation of this truth, give me leave to offer to you the≈øe following rea≈øons; The fir≈øt drawn from the nece≈ø≈øity of a known allegiance; that is a nece≈ø≈øity of knowing that Magi≈øtrates and ≈øubordinates have a lawful per≈øonal relation one to another; and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity of knowing what the power of the one, and duty of the other is being ≈øo related. And this a≈øwell in re≈øpect of the Governour, as of the governed: becau≈øe as the fir≈øt may ≈øin by impo≈øing upon tho≈øe over whom, and in ≈øuch ca≈øes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:167917:4"/>
wherein he hath no warrantable juri≈ødiction, ≈øo may the other by betraying their own per≈øons, liberty or propriety to an obtruded power, or by declining the duty he ows to his real Superior to comply with the more irregular power of an Alien.</p>
            <p>Now among≈øt Ma≈øters of Families equally free, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and uncompellable to a≈ø≈øociate, who have a ≈øole and equal juri≈ødiction over their re≈øpective ≈øubordinates, it will be but lo≈øt labour to finde out ≈øuch an allegiance but by con≈øent; and this, being pa≈ø≈øed, without limitation, by a≈ø≈øociated Ma≈øters of families, to ≈øuch of the A≈ø≈øociation, as they e≈øteem mo≈øt tru≈øty and able to manage publique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, convayes to the elected a ≈øole and independent power over the per≈øons and e≈øtates of the Electors, and all tho≈øe who doe depend upon them, to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes relating to common accommodation.</p>
            <p>To make out ≈øuch an Allegiance between a King and a People, or between the Lords and them, in the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they u≈øually claim: is altogether impo≈ø≈øible; For fir≈øt, they have no warrant to lay a foundation for Government, they cannot lawfully compel people to a≈ø≈øociate. Next becau≈øe the Royal pretences are generally drawn from the quality of the Office, that of the Lords for the effects of that qualification, and admitting that every Nation ought to be governed by a King, yet it will re≈øt que≈øtionable, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther every King ought to have that latitude of power which may be pretended; and that being allowed will not a≈ø≈øert the lawfulne≈ø≈øe of his per≈øonal calling to that Office, or determine what people are unque≈øtionably under his juri≈ødiction.</p>
            <p>The next is from the nature of municipal laws, by which it is unavoidably nece≈ø≈øary, for the peaceable being of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry populous Commonwealth, that many actions be made criminal, and many crimes lyable to puni≈øhment diver≈øly from what is pre≈øcribed by the finger of God. Such as are many of the ≈øeveral ≈øorts of Trea≈øons, petty Trea≈øon, Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, &amp; the like, puni≈øhable by death, or confi≈øcation, or both. Some whereof differ little from that of <hi>Shimei</hi> his going over the Brook <hi>Kedron,</hi> for which <hi>Solomon</hi> his King had no

power to take away his life, had not <hi>Shimei</hi> him≈øelf fir≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented to forfeit it upon that condition.</p>
            <p>In the making of the≈øe Laws there is an ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the Law-makers have a right of power over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons and E≈øtates of the whole People of that Nation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are to be executed: becau≈øe no man may di≈øpo≈øe of that wherein he hath not a lawful intere≈øt. That ≈øuch a right is not annexed to the Regal Office, is plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrable by that ≈øowre vengeance, which God took upon <hi>Ahab</hi> and his hou≈øe, for tampering to take away the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard and life of his known ≈øubject <hi>Naboth;</hi> and if Kings have not, neither have the Lords who derive only from Regal Prerogative; and if neither of the≈øe two have ≈øuch a right, it remains wholly in the Repre≈øentatives of the People, and they are the only Law-makers; unle≈ø≈øe there be ≈øomething more in the Clergy then in other Chri≈øtians, which will winde them in upon another ≈øcore to be ≈øharers in the ≈øame Authority. And that (with your patience) comes in the next place to be experimented.</p>
            <p>What claim they lay is ≈øaid to be derived from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles, of whom it is written, that they did not take upon them to di≈øpo≈øe of the goods of <hi>Ananias</hi> without his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, nor puni≈øh the detention without Miracle; and I think that unle≈ø≈øe they can entitle them≈øelves to the like qualifications, they will hardly <hi>Ex Officio</hi> prove them≈øelves competent Law-makers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I remember that Lin≈øy-wool≈øie garments were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to be worn by the children of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> as tho≈øe which being compo≈øed of ingredients of di≈øcordant and fretting quality, would not endure long in one and the ≈øame piece. Gods Word is po≈øitive, that no man can ≈øerve two ma≈øters. And when I ob≈øerved how wide the rents are which have been every where made in the Church of Chri≈øt by dividing the polity thereof into Eccle≈øia≈øtical and Civil, and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle light there is in the Word of God to direct people into a due and ≈øafe cour≈øe of obedience to each of the≈øe two ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities re≈øpectively, I was not apt to think the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to be at all con≈øi≈øtent with the wayes of God, or peace of the Nation.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:167917:5"/>
            <p>Yet ≈øomething they have to ≈øhoar up the Tradition, and that is the Prie≈øthood of <hi>I≈ørael,</hi> which they ≈øay doth typically relate to the≈øe Go≈øpel-times. Which no doubt is true; &amp; let them but ≈øu≈øpend their Hierarchy till they can produce one Law made by that Prie≈øthood while≈øt it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in its purity, and I think that will put an end to the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe. But here ≈øeems to me to lye the great mi≈øtake: They would have that Nation to be a type of one, or of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Nations only, whereas it was a Type of the whole world; the Levitical Prie≈øthood repre≈øenting who are, the re≈øt of the Tribes who are not of the hou≈øe-hold of faith, who though they be not within the pale, yet are not out of the purlew of the great Fore≈øt of Chri≈øt; and though not actually in, yet potentially and in expectancy are of the Church; for the benefits of Chri≈øts merits are extendable to all, though not taken hold of by all mankinde. And thus between the Type and the Antitype, there hold ≈øtill due corre≈øpondence, which would not hold ≈øo currant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the Type were applyed only to the Chri≈øtian part of the World: becau≈øe Chri≈øt hath made all tho≈øe Prie≈øts to God his Father, who have laid hold on him by faith.</p>
            <p>Their ≈øpiritual Charter of Authority is vacated, if they cannot prove them≈øelves to be ≈øolidly inve≈øted by God with the Prie≈øthood. And ≈øince the Son would not ≈øuffer his Di≈øciples to forbid that ≈øtranger to ca≈øt out Devils in his Name, who followed not him their Ma≈øter, me think I may ea≈øily infer, that no man who is endowed with ≈øo much grace as to believe all the Articles of faith e≈ø≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally nece≈ø≈øary to Salvation, is prohibited by the Father to impede the Devils entrance, by interpo≈øing tho≈øe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinary means which he hath pre≈øcribed. And this not alone in them≈øelves, but to all others: for love is a general duty, which hath reference to all mankinde; and it is little le≈ø≈øe then bla≈øphemy to think that God requires that at mans hand, without giving him a plenary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to expre≈ø≈øe it, nor can it be any way ≈øo well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øt as by endeavouring to make people capable of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of their Saviour. Among≈øt Chri≈øtians then there is none of the <hi>Quorum</hi> in this Commi≈ø≈øion, and I ≈øee not how any can be without the approbation and con≈øent of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:167917:6"/>
their a≈ø≈øociated fellow-Commi≈ø≈øioners; and I need not ≈øay, that the ≈øame rea≈øon which holds for Di≈øcipline that does for Doctrine.</p>
            <p>I might here for a further confirmation of the premi≈øes, minde you of ≈øome pertinent Texts in Scripture both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law and in the time of the Go≈øpel; and ≈øhew you that before God permitted the <hi>I≈øraelites</hi> to have Kings, which was upon an emergent occa≈øion, he gave a general Commi≈ø≈øion to the People to chu≈øe them Judges and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in all their Tribes. That <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> two Kings of that Nation, who have left behinde them as good a Character of righteous Government as any, called the people to con≈øult with them about two bu≈øine≈ø≈øes of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt importance, the one touching fetching home of the Ark, the other about keeping the Pa≈ø≈øeover. And that the Apo≈øtles, in taht weighty controver≈øie concerning Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumci≈øion, advi≈øed with the Elders and Brethren; and by their approbation ≈øent letters of reconciliation to the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenters. Whereby it is manife≈øt in what regard the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of the People was had in tho≈øe fir≈øt and be≈øt ages, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were in ≈øpiritual or temporal concernments. But I mu≈øt not ≈øpin out an Epi≈øtle into a Volume.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> by what hath been already offered to your con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I ≈øuppo≈øe that the nece≈ø≈øity of a known mutual Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance between Magi≈øtrates and ≈øubordinates is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt to you; and I conceive it no le≈ø≈øe apparent that ≈øuch an Allegiance cannot be created but by con≈øent: but ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no truth that meets not with ≈øome oppo≈øition, be≈øides tho≈øe already mentioned, bear a little longer I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeech you with my boldne≈ø≈øe, while≈øt I endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ≈øome other rubs of a later date, which po≈ø≈øibly may yet be thought equivalent or ≈øuperlative to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent.</p>
            <p>Suppo≈øe the provident hand of God in ≈øending down ≈øo many pregnant ble≈ø≈øings upon the Army, ≈øhould be urged as an evidence of Gods plea≈øure to confer the right of Authority upon the In≈øtruments. To manife≈øt that this will not beget that known mutual Allegiance which is nece≈ø≈øarily in≈øi≈øted upon, I ≈øhall humbly be≈øeech you to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:167917:6"/>
call to minde that the Parliament did fir≈øt vote the War, and then form and give Commi≈ø≈øion to the Army. That the People did elect, and thereby give power to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that Parliament, and a≈ø≈øi≈øt the Army in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, by their prayers, contributions, and corre≈øpondence. That together with the Commanders, the Infantry and Cavalry bore no incon≈øiderable ≈øhare in the great adventure for Liberty; and among≈øt all the≈øe I beleeve you will finde it as hard to determine upon whom Providence hath ca≈øt the lot of Government, as to under≈øtand by what Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it was conveyed; and no le≈ø≈øe difficult to di≈øcover pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øely who are ≈øubjected to the effects. Many publique ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited men there were, who laboured hard to prepare the way before ever the Parliament could be convened, or the Army march into the field; and not a few under who≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, during the long conte≈øt, God ≈øent the People ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øonable and ≈øignal deliverances; and though the good Ma≈øter of the Vine-yard gave as large a ≈øalary to the la≈øt comers as to the fir≈øt, yet he gave to all alike.</p>
            <p>I offer this only in relation to tho≈øe who have not been tainted with Delinquency to the State: for I ≈øhould not ≈øpeak my own rea≈øon, ≈øhould I ≈øay that an Army rai≈øed by Authority of Parliament to protect the Nation hath not power, ≈øo long as the Government continues un≈øetled, to u≈øe all requi≈øite means to di≈øcover and prevent clande≈øtine machinations, to ≈øuppre≈ø≈øe outrages and con≈øpiracies emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently de≈øtructive to the Peoples peace, to puni≈øh tho≈øe who are convicted offenders, and to hold tho≈øe under ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection who have for≈øeited their freedome, by being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in an offen≈øive War again≈øt the Supream Authority of the Nation: for they have appealed to their own ≈øwords, and being ca≈øt at a Bar of their own chu≈øing, they cannot truly be ≈øaid to ≈øuffer without their own con≈øents.</p>
            <p>Should it again be ≈øuppo≈øed, that, as it hath been of old in≈øi≈øted upon by the pretended Clergy, ≈øome peculiar and ≈øingular di≈øpen≈øation of grace to ≈øome Chri≈øtians above other ≈øome, doth carry with it a right to Soveraignty: I am confident you would not think that this rule will
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:167917:7"/>
reach all tho≈øe who are endowed with the ≈øame ≈øpirit; and I think not infallibly tho≈øe who are not therewith endowed: becau≈øe all other graces waiting upon, and receiving their vertue and efficacy through faith, and that being a hidden My≈øtery wrapt up in the ≈øoul of man, and vi≈øible only to the Eye of God, among≈øt tho≈øe who profe≈ø≈øe to this faith, it is not di≈øcoverable by any third per≈øon, who is and who is not capable of the ≈øame priviledges with real Beleevers.</p>
            <p>I con≈øe≈ø≈øe that it is undenyably true, that who≈øoever hath a true and lively faith, will ≈øhew it by his works: but good works (that is, morally good) may be done by tho≈øe who have no faith. Be≈øides, if works be the only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cognizance of grace, and that of Soveraignty, it may be concluded from the rule of contraries, that ≈øin denotes a want of grace, and a ≈øecluding from Soveraignty. And this will be ≈øo far from begetting a known mutual Allegiance between the Governours and governed, that it will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther de≈øtroy all Government, or tolerate tho≈øe to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours who are void of Grace: becau≈øe upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, either there will be no more Magi≈øtrates found to puni≈øh Malefactors, then there were accu≈øers remaining to ca≈øt the fir≈øt ≈øtone at the Adultere≈ø≈øe, or ≈øuch only as by profe≈ø≈øing them≈øelves to be without ≈øin do di≈øclaim any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt in a Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> It is not many moneths ≈øince there came a little pamphlet to my hands, which had ≈øomething in it not impertinent to the pre≈øent purpo≈øe, the Author ≈øaid to be a per≈øon, who formerly had written a larger Tract in vindication of the power and proceedings of the Peoples late elected Repre≈øentatives: but in this la≈øt urgeth that of the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> advi≈øing them to be obedient to <hi>Nero,</hi> who (without all contradiction) far ≈øurpa≈ø≈øed the late King in all kinde of wickedne≈ø≈øe, as an obligation upon all Chri≈øtians to ≈øubmit to that power what≈øoever it be under which their lot is fallen. I ≈øhall leave it to your better judgement to calculate what a huge weight of bloud this doctrine (if it be true) will lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the then Parliament, their Army, and all tho≈øe who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:167917:7"/>
did adhere or contribute to them, and waving the di≈øpute as that which hath been the ≈øubject of many ≈øatisfactory im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions, apply my ≈øelf only to ≈øhew how far the Authors opinion goes along with the Premi≈øes. From whence fir≈øt it may be concluded, that if tho≈øe primitive Chri≈øtians, who doubtle≈ø≈øe had then as much of the Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as great priviledges as any ≈øince their times, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Apo≈øtle to ≈øubmit to an Infidel power, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the gifts of the Spirit do not render the Receivers unque≈øtionably capable of command.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He acknowledgeth that if <hi>Nero</hi> had attained the Throne by the ≈øuffrage of the people, it had been more orderly then by the Senate, which it ≈øeems by him was not ≈øo elected; and if by the Senate le≈ø≈øe di≈øorderly, then by the artifice of his mother, and help of the Cohorts and re≈øt of the Souldiery. All this comes very neer to what I have delivered. And had he not been ≈øhort of telling his Readers of the ≈øin that <hi>Nero</hi> committed by falling upon the mo≈øt di≈øorderly way of the three, he had fully ju≈øtified my ≈øaying; for I endevour to maintain, that the right to chu≈øe their own Magi≈øtrates is in the people, and if it be granted that he that takes upon him to ≈øuperintend them without their con≈øent, is guilty of ≈øinne, their right is fully a≈ø≈øerted.</p>
            <p>If not in <hi>Nero</hi> an Infidel, yet to u≈øurp a power upon a ≈øelf-account is certainly a ≈øin in a Chri≈øtian, and that not of the ≈ømaller ≈øize: yet I will not determine that that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in the <hi>The≈ø≈øalonians,</hi> wherein the Man of ≈øin is ≈øaid to ≈øit in the Temple of God as God, may in a degree be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to any per≈øons, who being Members of Chri≈øts Church, do under the pretence of ≈øome peculiar divine di≈øpen≈øation, exerci≈øe a coercive juri≈ødiction over their brethren of the ≈øame faith, though that in <hi>Peter,</hi> wherein Chri≈øtians are forbidden to Lord it over Gods inheritance, ≈øeems very much to countenance the application: But I may ≈øay, and yet preach no fal≈øe doctrine, that it is not the vocall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, but the actuall prelation or Prelating that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the guilt.</p>
            <p>Be this the ≈øen≈øe of the Holy Gho≈øt or be it not, it had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:167917:8"/>
not been unworthy the late ≈øelf-voters ≈øerious thoughts to con≈øider, whether he that makes a Law to compell others to pay Sub≈øidies and Contributions, or to hazard their lives in the face of an enemy, or by which any other is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his Liberty, Goods, Lands, or Life for counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting the publique coyne or Seals, do not thereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ≈øin little inferiour to that of <hi>Ahab,</hi> and make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf obnoxious to the like puni≈øhment, unle≈ø≈øe he have ≈øome ≈øuch warrant as <hi>Solomon</hi> had to take away the life of his ≈øubject <hi>Shimei.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Liberty hath been proclaimed, which, among≈øt a≈ø≈øociated people, who mu≈øt live under a Law, con≈øi≈øts only in the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of electing Law-makers. Indeed con≈øent is that alone that takes the ≈øtain of oppre≈ø≈øion and antichri≈øtian u≈øurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the authority of Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrates. It is the ≈øpring that gives motion to all the wheels in the Watch of National Government. And whether the ca≈øe of Government be handled under a Civil or under an Eccle≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a≈øtical notion, your Authority ≈øpringing from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of the people, ≈øtill remains the ≈øame ≈øole and intire, without any dependency or commixture, what pretences ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever have been interpo≈øed. The peoples independent power is con≈øigned over to you, by which you are inve≈øted as well with the Supreme as with the Legi≈ølative power, for they are twins not to be ≈øeparated, but by a mutual and total Annihilation. This is the authority and priviledge of Parliament; and you are the Guardians of this Priviledge and Authority. If it mi≈øcarry through your default, you fail in your Tru≈øt, and the ≈øin will lye at your own door.</p>
            <p>You need not object the want of Pre≈øidents, you have the example of the peoples la≈øt Repre≈øentatives, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly acted by the≈øe ju≈øtifiable Principles, and were cheerfully ≈øeconded by the people with liberal Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. You have the concurrence of the <hi>Scotti≈øh</hi> nation before it was ≈øeduced; and the agreement and cooperation of the Commanders in chief, and of the re≈øt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, Officers and Souldiers of both Armies. You have the ≈øame Army ≈øtill under the ≈øame Commanders, who
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:167917:8"/>
would not certainly have ingaged ≈øo deep in the quarrel, had they not been fully ≈øatisfied of the ju≈øtne≈øs of the Cau≈øe. And therefore ≈øeeing your authority is the ≈øame, and that you are not convened without their approbation, to fear to proceed upon the ≈øame ju≈øt and honourable principles, were to ≈øeem to ≈øu≈øpect them of the ignominious crime of Apo≈øta≈øie, and that would be taken as ill, as to tell a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier that he is run from his colours.</p>
            <p>You have had a fair Copy ≈øet you, and the people will have little cau≈øe to give you thanks, if you ≈øuffer it to be fullied in your tran≈øcribing. By their in≈øi≈øting upon their own power the Lawes of the land are rendred more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative: for the legi≈ølative power being ≈øolely in the Repre≈øentatives of the People, there wanted not cau≈øe to apprehend that all the former Statutes and Charters of this Commonwealth, not excepting <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or any other Statute or Charter what≈øoever, being hammered out under a kinde of controlment of Kings and Lords Spirituall and Temporal, who ≈øeldome were remi≈ø≈øe to improve their own pretentions, were (if not illegitimate and invalid, yet) not vertual enough to prevent unquiet expo≈øtulations; and what≈øoever virulent and exa≈øperated tongues may ≈øugge≈øt, po≈øterity will entertain it as an act of prudence, ju≈øtice and honour in your Predece≈ø≈øors, who were intru≈øted with the intere≈øt of the people, to free the legi≈ølative power out of the former Ward≈øhip, and to rea≈ø≈øume it to them≈øelves, by who≈øe ≈øole authority the Lawes and Statutes of the Nation might be tendred le≈ø≈øe ≈øubject to querulous cen≈øure, and more obliging.</p>
            <p>As it is in making, ≈øo it is in executing of Lawes, the power by which they are executed will be doubtfull and controvertable, if it be not derived from the clear ≈øtream of the peoples con≈øent. This was plainly experimented the late Kings ca≈øe, who≈øe claim being of another nature, and his title and power therefore uncertain, fill'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion full of con≈øuming di≈ø≈øen≈øions. Whereas had he in≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only upon the con≈øent of the people, he might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved the peace of the Nation, re≈øcued his per≈øon and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from tho≈øe ≈øharp encounters under which they have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:167917:9"/>
≈øince ≈øuffered, and ≈øecured his office from that hideous ≈øtorm with which it was at la≈øt overwhelmed: for had he owned his inve≈øtiture from the People, by which all tho≈øe litigations that cau≈øed the di≈øtempers had been removed, the Regall office (be≈øides that it had the tru≈øt of ≈øeeing the Lawes duly executed) being military, and ≈øo taken to be in the ≈øen≈øe of Scripture, there was no cau≈øe why it ≈øhould be thought an office prohibited by God, or why the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of a title ≈øhould make wi≈øe men ≈øtumble at ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary a ≈øupplement to their own defence and ≈øafety.</p>
            <p>But no title would ≈øerve turn, but divine right, and that mounting him upon too elevating wings, precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated him to de≈øtruction; and prevailed with his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, apprehending thereby ≈øomething in his per≈øon or office, above the ordinary pitch of humanity, to hazard their per≈øons and e≈øtates in a war again≈øt that authority, again≈øt which had they prevailed, they had fought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves into ≈øuch a ≈øervitude, as their own va≈ø≈øals will not brook to hear of without regret and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The very ≈øame Simple was found out, a≈øwell by the Epi≈øcopall as by the Presbyterian party, and each of them apply'd it as a cordiall to their Eccle≈øia≈øticall polity. You will be≈øt judge of the vertue, if you plea≈øe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve the operation. That you may ≈øee how low they have brought it, give me leave to unca≈øe this their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
            <p>Grant they mu≈øt, that the primitive Chri≈øtians had within them≈øelves a peculiar kinde of Government, or el≈øe their in≈øi≈øting upon the like in the pre≈øent Church is meerly idle, and they cannot make any pretence to any Government peculiar to Chri≈øtians of the fir≈øt ages, but what was in their hands who were di≈øtingui≈øhed by the denominations of Bi≈øhops, Presbyters, or Elders and Deacons. So that although all of the≈øe did or might preach, yet their office was not Doctrinal but Di≈øcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. And this I ≈øhall endevour to make further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the≈øe rea≈øons. Fir≈øt, becau≈øe they were approved
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:167917:9"/>
fit for tho≈øe Offices by their known care and skill to govern well their own families. Next, becau≈øe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Apo≈øtle to chu≈øe ≈øome to officiate in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments relating to di≈øcipline, to the end, that they who were ≈øet apart for Doctrine, might not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from that more nece≈ø≈øary duty, would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted them al≈øo from any office of that nature, had tho≈øe Bi≈øhops and the re≈øt been of the Doctrinall order.</p>
            <p>They were then no more but civill Magi≈øtrates in a Chri≈øtian colony; and I think that the Government of this Nation by a Repre≈øentative Councel of the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, wherein the Speaker may be properly termed the Bi≈øhop, Superintendent or Prelate, and the re≈øt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers the Elder≈øhip or Presbytery, is not at all different from that of the primitive Churches, ≈øave only in the variation of title, which, though it hath made a huge noi≈øe in the Chri≈øtian world, are no more but the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe in a different dialect.</p>
            <p>It is as po≈ø≈øible to ≈øtop water from returning to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Center, as to dam up authority from the Sea of the people. But the opinion of holine≈ø≈øe dazles the eyes of wi≈øe men. It will ca≈øt a ≈øad reflection upon the ≈øoule of every ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearted Chri≈øtian, who is no enemy to the unity and pro≈øperity of this Nation, when he con≈øiders how many of her natives, men of able and active parts, who might therefore be of ≈øingular u≈øe to this Common-wealth, have made them≈øelves uncapable of being imployed in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agery of publique affairs, and of joyning together in Communion with their brethren of the ≈øame faith and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by drawing counter to a milde and warrantable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in the more rigid and chargeable yoke of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Hierarchy, that hath not whereupon to lay a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but what hath been here expre≈øt.</p>
            <p>The attribute of holine≈ø≈øe is common to all Beleevers; and, although in the primitive times, when Chri≈øtians were under a twofold kinde of Government, the one pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to them≈øelves, the other Emperial and in common

with them to all other people under that juri≈ødiction, they might make u≈øe of the terme, to di≈øtingui≈øh between their own and the Emperial polity, yet being in that point now all equal, their polity cannot be otherwi≈øe formed but by moral and prudential Principles, which had it been ≈øo under≈øtood, would have long agoe reconciled the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Recu≈øants to the Engli≈øh Di≈øcipline; and the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conforming Prote≈øtants to tho≈øe indifferent things of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and order, which have been heretofore bogled at as ≈øuper≈øtitious and idolatrous, in regard they were ≈øtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the ≈øu≈øpicious ≈øpots of imputative ≈øanctity.</p>
            <p>This, together with the activity of the Mini≈øtry in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding them≈øelves into di≈øciplinary negotiations, is that which hath wrought the Office into di≈øta≈øt with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but were this Remora removed, and they content to conform them≈øelves to the Apo≈øtles Rule, not to leave the Word of God to ≈øerve tables, I cannot think that in this Common-wealth, any ingenuous man would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it le≈ø≈øe convenient to have a ≈øetled Mini≈øtery for all publique oratories, then to have Judges ≈øelected from among≈øt others of the ≈øame profe≈ø≈øion to ≈øit in places of judicature, as that which is providentially nece≈ø≈øary to avoid confu≈øion where there is a parity. And thus the quarrellings about the ordination and maintenance of Mini≈øters, together with tho≈øe formal accommodations, which do pertain to their officiating, may receive a ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory compo≈øure, being taken only as civill in≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and regulated by the Repre≈øentatives of the nation, who by the unlimited con≈øent of the people intere≈øted in all capacities, are qualified to pre≈øcribe, a≈øwell unpre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented formes of admini≈øtration in publique devotions, as unexampled puni≈øhments for new coyned crimes; and with the ≈øame obligation upon the con≈øciences of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenters.</p>
            <p>Some object that the <hi>Galatians</hi> had Congregations inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent one of another, which were accounted and called Churches, and therefore they think that national Churches are not allowable. What then? A Parliamentary power

they acknowledge. Mu≈øt then every Congregation or Cla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis ≈ømell of the old leaven, and have within it ≈øelf an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øia≈øtical juri≈ødiction? Admit they mu≈øt. From whence comes this Juri≈ødiction, but from the con≈øent of the parties congregated? and by the like con≈øent it is conveyed again to the Repre≈øentatives of the Nation, by which they are inve≈øted with their ≈øole power, unle≈ø≈øe they can produce ≈øome clau≈øe of re≈øervation.</p>
            <p>But truly I conceive their allegation will not hold: for it is plain that in the fir≈øt ages, there were Churches in private hou≈øes, which by their own confe≈ø≈øion did not goe again≈øt Gods order in forming them≈øelves into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; and to enlarge Congregations into National Churches, ≈øeems not to be le≈ø≈øe agreeable to his plea≈øure: becau≈øe it comes neerer to that great de≈øign of God, to bring all true Beleevers into one fold under one Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard Chri≈øt Je≈øus. And therefore this of the <hi>Galatians</hi> I conceive to be cau≈øed by the interpo≈øition of their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferencing neighbours, who being Infidels hindered that free intercour≈øe and Communion, which had been more agreeable to their profe≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>What ≈øhould I ≈øay more? You are the independent Presbytery or Elder≈øhip of this Cla≈ø≈øis or Congregation of the Chri≈øtian World, who have the ≈øole power of making and repealing Laws, and of placing and di≈øplacing ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Officers, whether Magi≈øterial or Mini≈øterial, as ≈øhall in your judgements ≈øeem mo≈øt conducing to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique accommodation. And this form of Government wherein the native equality and liberty of every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Member of this Commonwealth is indifferently and unanimou≈øly ≈øubmitted to per≈øons elected by them≈øelves, for the advancement of every mans private together with the publique intere≈øt, may (be≈øides tho≈øe that I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready run over) fully ≈øatisfie the Levelling party, who have as well an equall freedome to elect, as an equall po≈ø≈øibility to be the elected; except their de≈øign runs ≈øo high, as an aym to ca≈øt all ≈øublunary ble≈ø≈øings into one joynt ≈øtock, for an equal benefit to all mankinde; and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:167917:11"/>
if this be their plot (though it were the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtore me to the capacity of eating daily bread, yet) I mu≈øt not bear a part in it: becau≈øe the command of God to relieve the poore is a void command, if in the Goods of this world they have a right to an equall proportion; nor may it be admitted that God forbids not Man to cover his neighbours, but his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</p>
            <p>Thus have I wound my ≈øelf out of the maze of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Government a≈ø≈øi≈øted by the clew of Con≈øent. And now (me thinks) I might more properly call it a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Directory, in≈øtructing a≈ø≈øociated families to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in an hone≈øt and peaceable corre≈øpondence one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another for publique pre≈øervation; and this drawn out by their own Repre≈øentatives, pre≈øcribing civil rules, and ordaining Officers a≈øwell to ≈øee tho≈øe rules ob≈øerved, as to puni≈øh offenders according to the rules by them pre≈øcribed, wherein there is no injury or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pul≈øion, becau≈øe acted by con≈øent, which being volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary layes upon every man an equall obligation; and the≈øe rules being repealable by the Tru≈øtees of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by what titles ≈øoever tho≈øe Magi≈øtrates who are by them con≈øtituted, are di≈øtingui≈øhed, the power of the people is not taken away, but they continue ≈øtill the Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents under Chri≈øt their King.</p>

               <hi>Sir,</hi> What de≈øolations have befallen this Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by the fatal divi≈øions which happened among≈øt the Members of the late elected Parliament, cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred without a ≈øad re≈øentment; and it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible that ≈øome of tho≈øe different opinions, which have hitherto nouri≈øhed private animo≈øities among≈øt the people, may yet have too great a reflection upon your A≈ø≈øembly. Your unity may binde up the≈øe wounds; and truly in this which I have offered to that end, I ≈øee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing deviating from the Will of God, or incon≈øi≈øtent with the ju≈øt ends of Government; and therefore not the Je≈ø≈øe likely to be in≈øtrumental to concord.</p>
            <p>It is the re≈øtraining of ≈øin, and a tendency to his glory,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:167917:11"/>
that renders National Government accepted with God. There is a failer in both the≈øe, if Government be not built up upon a ju≈øt and right foundation; and ≈øin ≈øeldom draws along with it Gods protection. Ju≈øtice exalteth a Nation, but ≈øin is a ≈øhame to any People, is the aphori≈øm of the wi≈øe≈øt <hi>Solomon.</hi> Be≈øides that it cannot be without ≈øin, this Nation hath experimentally felt that two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoy≈øing powers in one politique, is as mon≈øtrous as a heart and a heart in one natural body.</p>

               <hi>Sir,</hi> My zeal for God and my Nation hath made me too much a tre≈øpa≈ø≈øer upon your patience. But pro≈øperity flowes there, where righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe and peace doe ki≈ø≈øe each other. This is the object of my prayers, this the object of my wi≈øhes, this the object of my endevours, and this is that which hath drawn upon you the trouble of this rude pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentment. I have heard the ≈øad complaints of the People who ju≈øtly cry out for redre≈ø≈øe, and I de≈øpair not of ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øome healing applications. I know that the many tempe≈øtuous counter bla≈øts, which have broken in upon this Nation, have driven in before them exa≈øperating ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities. But let him that expects a ≈øtrict ob≈øervance of rule amid≈øt ≈øuch high di≈øtractions, betake him≈øelf to frame ≈øome curious ma≈øter-piece, in the main top of a ≈øhip to≈ø≈øed with ahideous ≈øtorm, con≈øtant in no point of the Compa≈ø≈øe, and there try what credit he can get by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. The rigor of the Law is often injurious, where it meets not with ≈øome qualification. In tho≈øe actions which are not ≈øteered in a direct cour≈øe, nece≈ø≈øity excu≈øeth the Pilot, if they be directed to a right Haven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I have heard that one of the brave≈øt Generals that ever commanded the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, after he had victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly a≈ø≈øerted the peoples liberty, and put an end to a Civil war, offered up his power and Commi≈ø≈øion to the then a≈ø≈øembled Senate, by whom he was re-inve≈øted and gratified with more triumphant dignities. Here was a fair and honorable corre≈øpondence. And this procured a pre≈øent and la≈øting peace to that Empire, and rendered it flouri≈øhing and formidable.</p>

               <hi>Sir,</hi> I have now di≈øcharged my Con≈øcience without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign, without partiality, without prejudice. Your bu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe is great, Your tru≈øt great, I have now no more to doe but to pro≈øtrate my ≈øelf at the feet of him who is the Fountain of all goodne≈ø≈øe, humbly praying that he will direct you in all your con≈øultations to reflect ≈øtill upon his glory, the ≈øalvation of your own ≈øouls, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and welfare of this disjoynted Nation.
